# SageOne Brasil Local Programming Exercise.

This exercise is intended to be applied in a face-to-face interview. You should answer these questions without using a computer or internet. Use only a pencil, a paper and you expertise. :smirk:

### General Rules:
- You can write the answer using any programming language. The goal here is not to evaluate your Ruby experience. Dont care about the perfect syntax. The goal is to see your familiarity with algorithms and logic skills.
- You **CANT** use modern languages helpers functions. You cant use Ruby's `.to_s` or `.to_i` for instance. You can **only** basic code structures and data types.


### Exercices:

1. Write an algorithm that sum all the elements present in an `Array`. It takes an `Array` as input and should return the sum of all elements inside:

  ```ruby
  array_sum([14,52,67,44])
  # should return 177
  ```
  ---

2. Write an algorithm that revert a given string. It should invert every string character:

  ```ruby
  revert_string('Marco')
  # should return 'ocraM'
  ```

  > TIP: You can assume that a string is an Array of characters with no problem.

3. Write a function that convert an `Integer` to a `String`. **Remember:** you **cant** use existing helper functions like `1234.to_s` :cry:

  ```ruby
  integer_to_string(1234)
  # should return '1234'
  ```
  ---

4. Now the oposite, write a function that convert a `String` to an `Integer`. Again, you **cant** use existing helper functions like `"7485".to_i`.

  ```ruby
  string_to_integer("7485")
  # should return 7485
  ```
